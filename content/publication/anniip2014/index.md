abstract: An accepted model for the saccade signal of ocular motor neurons comprises two components in the form of a pulse and a step. In this contribution, an assessment of two fitting functions for the saccadic pulse component is made, in order to obtain a reduced set of descriptors that could be used for the early diagnosis of ataxia. Results show that both models have achieved to describe the waveform of the saccadic pulse signal, revealing higher performance of Gauss series over the gamma function.

abstract: A saccade is an ocular movement that is characterized by speed and precision. The velocity profile of this movement is used to extract the maximum speed value, that is one of the most important features of the saccade. A gamma function was used by other authors to describe the waveform shape of the velocity profile. However, this function does not present an optimal profile description in records of patients suffering from Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 2. In order to find a function that better describes the velocity profile, this contribution compares the fittings of several functions through visual and numerical analysis. Results showed a better performance of the partial sums of gaussian series and a gaussian fit function.
